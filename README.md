# NLP
NLP for sentiment and topic classification on comments.

- Sentiment Classification: Positive, Neutral, Negative based on certain thresholds.
- Topic Classification: Content, Technical and Design problems.

This was done during my internship in the summer of 2020, classifying comments given by users in learning modules, to help improve the modules.

Libraries utilized were from Python, namely pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and matplotlib.
